# Project Overview
Includes Python and R programming languages.




## Project:
- [Analysis of District Rearrangement to Address Gerrymandering](https://github.com/ollill0823/101.UIUC_MS_IE-532-Analysis-of-Network-Data/tree/main/005.Final_project) **Key word: Python, Gurobi Optimizer**
    - I have chosen the **[gerrymandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering)** problem for my final project in Social Network (IE532). There have been [rumors](https://michaelturton.blogspot.com/2008/02/gerrymandering.html) about several districts experiencing unbiased re-arrangement in Taiwan 20 years ago. The second district in Taichung is one of the most apparent examples. According to [Taichung legislative redistricting](https://frozengarlic.wordpress.com/2010/05/21/taichung-legislative-redistricting/), The initial intent of the distribution was population rearrangement, but it inadvertently offered an alternative legical explanation for politician to develop their political boundaries. The redrawn Legislative Yuan constituencies in Taichung indirectly contributed to the KMT party's (the blue one) decisive victory in the elections in 2008. The second district is particularly noteworthy in this context, experiencing significant changes within Taichung county. Uniquely situated in Taiwan, this area connects coastal regions, urban residential areas, and mountainous areas. Therefore, The objective of this project is to leverage **Gurobi** to identify the optimal distribution and subsequently compare it with the existing situation. If the simulation meets our expectations, we can suggest that the rumor is convincing. Additionally, we aim to explore how controlling the re-arrangement could impact the drawing of boundaries to secure the best legislator votes. We will utilize the 2018 legislator votes as our dataset. Within the analysis, we will classify the votes into two major groups: [the DPP and the KMT party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_Yuan_constituencies_in_Taichung_City).

- [Analysis of Shohei Ohtani's 2022 Pitching and Batting Data](https://github.com/ollill0823/005.UCLA_extension_R-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization/tree/main/010.2022_Shohei_Ohtani) **Key word: R, Baseball analysis**
    - **Shohei Ohtani**, acknowledged as one of the premier baseball players globally, was not initially perceived as powerful as he is today. His pitching and batting performance have undergone significant development since 2022, leaving unknown reasons behind his remarkable season. Despite not securing the final MVP title, his accomplishments undeniably place him at the pinnacle of the sport. In a season marked by heightened competition and noteworthy achievements (such as Aaron Judge's historically high home runs), Ohtani maintained a batting performance comparable to his previous year. Notably, while his batting statistics remained consistent, his pitching performance saw a remarkable improvement compared to the 2021 season. In this project, my analysis will delve into the factors contributing to Ohtani's sustained batting prowess and explore the adjustments he made to enhance his pitching capabilities.

- [Analysis of the 2020 American Presidential Votes](https://github.com/ollill0823/005.UCLA_extension_R-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization/tree/main/009.2020_American_president_votes) **Key word: R**
  - I am intrigued by the 2020 presidential election and aim to uncover the primary reasons behind the Democratic Party's victory. In comparison to the 2016 American presidential election, five swing states shifted their electoral votes to the Democratic Party, signifying a significant change in the political landscape. To investigate the shift, I will utilize the raw data from the [American National Election Studies (ANES)](https://electionstudies.org/data-center/2020-time-series-study/). By analyzing the polling data, we can identify the root causes that influenced these changes and led to the Democratic Party's success.

- [Final project: Analyzing the pitcher performance through years](https://github.com/ollill0823/102.UIUC_MS_CS-412-Introduction-to-Data-Mining) **Key word: Python, Baseball analysis, machine learning model, regression**
  - This study delves into baseball analytics using data mining techniques. Key steps include data preprocessing, feature enhancement, and deriving predictive features. Two prediction systems, "score difference" and "reward," are explored. Regression models, including Linear Regression and Neural Network, are employed. The "reward" system outperforms, exhibiting more consistent results. Challenges include outliers, team dynamics, and pitcher fatigue. Further improvements could involve additional parameters and considering team contributions for a more holistic prediction. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into baseball analytics, emphasizing the complex interplay of factors affecting game outcomes.

- [Final project: Analyzing Flight Delays and Cancellations in the USA](https://github.com/ollill0823/103.UIUC_MS_CS-442-Database-Systems/tree/main) **Key word: SQL, Google Cloud Platform, Javascript, Neo4j, HTML page**
  - Executing the SQL table creation on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** for the Flight Delays and Cancellation dataset in 2015 USA. Prior to the SQL implementation, preparing the **ER diagram** and **URL version Diagram** for dataset diversification. Integrating **JavaScript** coding into **Neo4j** to generate an interactive question-and-answer **HTML page**.
